There are several kinds of seismic waves. The body waves that arrive first in the seismograph and can travel through the medium or inner layers of the earth, consist of the P or compressional and S or shear waves.
Another kind of waves are the surface waves. Surface waves travel only on the surface of the earth and decay with the depth. One example of these waves are the Love and Rayleigh waves.






Body waves are the first to observe in a seismogram. S waves are slower than the P waves.The velocity of the shear waves is about the 60% of the velocity of the compressional waves.
For this reason the first arrivals are P waves, then the shear waves and lastly the surface waves.
This distinction is apparent in the seismogram in relatively high hypocentral distances from the source, where we observe two different and steep amplitude changes.
The first arrival is always the compressional waves and the second one is the shear waves. The time distance between them depends mainly on the hypocentral distance.
Other phases of P and S waves can also be recorded in the seismogram.
